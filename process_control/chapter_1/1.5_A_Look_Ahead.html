        Chapter 2 develops fundamental models based on material and energy balances, while Chapter 3 covers dynamic analysis. Chapter 4 shows how to develop empirical models from plant tests. Chapter 5 is an introduction to feedback control and provides the first look at quantitative control-system design procedures.

        The best way to understand process control is to work many problems. In particular, it is important to use simulation for complex problems. A numerical package that is particularly useful for control-system analysis and simulation is MATLAB; the SIMULINK block-diagram simulator is particularly useful. If you are not familiar with MATLAB/ SIMULINK, we recommend that you work through the MATLAB and SIMULINK tutorials (Modules 1 and 2). Simply reading the tutorials will not give you much insight into the use of MATLAB; you must sit at a computer, work through the examples, and try new ideas that you have.
