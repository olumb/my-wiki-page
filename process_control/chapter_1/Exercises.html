    <h2>6. Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU)</h2>
    <p>
        A fluidized catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) produces a significant portion of the gasoline produced by a typical petroleum refinery. A typical FCCU processes 30,000 Bbl/day (1 Bbl = 42 gallons) of heavy gas oil from a crude oil distillation unit, producing roughly 15,000 Bbl/day of gasoline, along with streams of other components. The value of gasoline alone produced by this unit is on the order of $500,000/day, so any improvement in yield and energy consumption owing to improved control can have a significant economic impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Question:</strong> A control system revamp for a 30,000 Bbl/day FCCU is estimated to cost $2 million. It is expected that the implementation of advanced control schemes will result in an economic increase of 2% in the value of products produced. Based on the value of gasoline alone, how many days will it take to pay back the control system investment?
    </p>

    <h2>7. Furnace Control System</h2>
    <p>
        Furnaces are often used to heat process streams to temperatures above 400°F. A typical fired furnace may have a heat duty of 100 x 10<sup>6</sup> Btu/hour, requiring roughly 1667 scfm (standard cubic feet per minute) of natural gas (methane has a fuel value of approximately 1000 Btu/scf). The cost of this fuel gas is on the order of $5/1000 scf, yielding an annual fuel cost of $4.4 million/year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Excess combustion air is needed to assure complete combustion; however, too much excess air wastes energy (the heated air simply goes out the exhaust stack). Too little excess air leads to incomplete combustion, wasting energy and polluting the atmosphere with unburned hydrocarbons. It is important, then, to deliver an optimum amount of combustion air to the furnace. With the large flow rates and high temperatures involved, maintaining safe operation is also very important. The control system must be designed so that excess combustion air is maintained, no matter what is happening to the fuel gas flow rate. A fired furnace control system clearly needs to satisfy safety, environmental, and economic criteria.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Question:</strong> An advanced control scheme is estimated to save 2% in energy costs, for a fired furnace with a heat duty of 100 x 10<sup>6</sup> Btu/hour. If it is desired to have a 2-year payback period on this control system investment, what is the maximum investment allowable?

    <h2>9. Feedback and Feed-Forward Control in the Human Body</h2>
    <p>
        The human body is composed of many innate feedback and feed-forward control loops. For example, insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to regulate the blood glucose concentration. The pancreas in a type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic has lost the ability to produce significant insulin. An insulin-dependent diabetic must monitor their blood glucose (accurate blood glucose strips have been on the market for years) and provide insulin injections several times per day. It is particularly important to use knowledge of the meal characteristics to determine the amount of insulin necessary to compensate for the glucose.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Discuss the actions taken by a type I diabetic in terms of the formulation of a control problem:</b> State the objectives and list all variables, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Control objectives</li>
                <li>Input variables (manipulated and disturbance)</li>
                <li>Output variables (measured and unmeasured)</li>
                <li>Constraints (hard and soft)</li>
                <li>Safety, environmental, and economic considerations</li>

            <b>Automated Closed-Loop System:</b> It is desirable to form an automated closed-loop system, using:

    <h2>10. Heat Exchanger Control Instrumentation Diagrams</h2>
    <p>
        Consider the following three heat exchanger control instrumentation diagrams. For each diagram (a, b, and c), the objective is to maintain a desired cold stream outlet temperature. Since the cold stream exiting the exchanger is fed to a reactor, it is important that the stream temperature never be substantially higher than the setpoint value. Answer the questions for each strategy, and provide an overall discussion in part (d).

    <h2>11. Feedback Control in Surgery</h2>
    <p>
        During surgery, it is crucial for an anesthesiologist to regulate a patient's blood pressure to a desired value. This is achieved by adjusting the infusion rate of vasoactive drugs administered to the patient. Additionally, blood pressure is influenced by the level of anesthetic given to the patient.
    </p>
    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    <p>
        In the context of feedback control, the anesthesiologist acts as the controller in a manual control loop:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The blood pressure is the <strong>measured output</strong>.</li>
        <li>The infusion rate of vasoactive drugs is the <strong>manipulated input</strong>.</li>
        <li>The level of anesthetic is a <strong>disturbance</strong> affecting the system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The anesthesiologist observes the blood pressure readings and adjusts the infusion rate of the vasoactive drugs to maintain the blood pressure at a desired level (setpoint). This is a classic example of a feedback control loop where the process output (blood pressure) is continuously monitored and compared with the setpoint to adjust the input (drug infusion rate).
    </p>

    <h3>Automated System Control Block Diagram</h3>
    <p>
        An automated system for regulating blood pressure could be implemented using a continuous blood pressure measurement device and an automated infusion pump for vasoactive drugs. The control block diagram for such a system is shown below:
    </p>
    <div class="figure">

        <p class="figure-caption">Figure: Control Block Diagram for Automated Blood Pressure Regulation</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        In this diagram:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sensor:</strong> Measures the patient's blood pressure continuously.</li>
        <li><strong>Controller:</strong> Compares the measured blood pressure to the desired setpoint and calculates the required change in the infusion rate.</li>
        <li><strong>Actuator:</strong> Adjusts the infusion pump to deliver the appropriate rate of vasoactive drugs.</li>
    </ul>
