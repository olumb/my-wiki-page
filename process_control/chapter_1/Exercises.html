    <ol>
        <li>
            Discuss the following problems (a–g) in the context of control:
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Identify control objectives;</li>
                <li>Identify input variables and classify as (a) manipulated or (b) disturbance;</li>
                <li>Identify output variables and classify these as (a) measured or (b) unmeasured;</li>
                <li>Identify constraints and classify as (a) hard or (b) soft;</li>
                <li>Identify operating characteristics and classify as (a) continuous, (b) batch, (c) semicontinuous (or semibatch);</li>
                <li>Discuss safety, environmental, and economic considerations;</li>
                <li>Discuss the types of control (feed forward or feedback).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Measurements and manipulated variables can vary continuously or may be sampled discretely.</p>
            <p>Select from the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a. Driving a car</li>
                <li>b. Choose one of your favorite activities (skiing, basketball, making a cappuccino, etc.)</li>
                <li>c. A stirred tank heater</li>
                <li>d. Beer fermentation</li>
                <li>e. An activated sludge process</li>
                <li>f. A household thermostat</li>
                <li>g. Air traffic control</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            Literature Review. The process control research literature can be challenging to read, with unique notations and rigorous mathematical analyses. Find a paper from one of the magazines or journals listed in Section 1.4 that you would like to understand by the time you have completed this textbook. Use the following criteria for your selection:
            <ul>
                <li>The process is interesting to you (do not choose mainly a theory paper)</li>
                <li>The modeling equations and parameters are in the paper (make certain the equations are ordinary differential equations and not partial differential equations)</li>
                <li>There are plots that you can verify (eventually) through simulation (the plots should be based on simulation results)</li>
                <li>The control algorithm is clearly written</li>
                <li>The objectives of the paper are reasonably clear to you</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Provide the following:</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>A short (one paragraph) summary of the overall objectives of the paper; why are you interested in the paper?</li>
                <li>A short list of words and concepts in the paper that are familiar to you.</li>
            </ol>
